                    Fine Arts and Modelling club is one of the official clubs of NIT Kurukshetra. It is the hub of artists who come together
                    to ameliorate and sustain art culture in the college. And while doing the same, it provides ample opportunities to those
                    with artistic inclination to hone and flaunt their skills with art and craft.
